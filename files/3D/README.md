# 3D Files

### Description
3D files are not one extension, but any file format under 3D specs that represent a three-dimensional object. They include ```.stl``` files, ```.obj``` files, ```.blend``` files and many more. 

### Usage
1. Create a 3D Model with a tool like [3D Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
2. Save as a OBJ or another 3D file format.
3. Open the file or use [3D Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.vscode-3dviewer) in VS Code!
